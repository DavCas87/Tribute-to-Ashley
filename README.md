# Tribute-to-Ashley
This is a practice project from free code camp that I wanted to be able to share.
I'm supposed to create a tribute page to practice html and css, focusing on using classes and id's, and adding some css.
I chose Ashley because she is my girlfriend and she deserves a big shout out for the woman she is so I thought she would like this.
They are very basic pages but I'm a newbie and this is practice and I like it!
